This module provides a customizable set of blocks which contain a defined & limited number
of links to nodes that are considered "relevant" to the current node based on how the current
node is tagged under it's taxonomy. The more terms another node has in common
with the current not, the more chance it has at appearing towards the top of
the list. If multiple nodes contain the same number of "terms in common" then
the more recent ones appear towards the top of the list.
