6.x-1.0 (2010-01-21)
====================

This is the first stable release of the Modal Frame CCK Editor module. Notes below detail changes made since initial checkin to CVS.

- Initial release for testing.
- Prevent from sending Drupal.settings more than once to the page.
- Externalize the real code into separate include files to minimize memory consumption when module features are not in use. When you have a lot of modules, every little bit helps.
- Do not apply Drupal.checkPlain() to button title because this is already done using Drupal.t() with the @ placeholder.
- Ignore field group from view processing if access to the content element has been denied.
- Implement hook_content_fieldapi() and hook_node_type() to clean up possible variables related to our module features, if any.
- Added an option to reload the page after a successful edit operation.
- Implement a method to allow external modules implement additional features during onSubmit callback processing of the modal frame.
- If the field group is collapsible, make sure we do not render it collapsed.
- Typo in hook name. I forgot to add the _alter suffix. Oops!
- Fix the method used to hide elements in the node edit form.
- #687144 Provide support to edit individual fields in modal frames as well.
- It should not be possible to allow edition of fields that are part of a multigroup. This is because delta values for fields in multigroups must be in sync with each other.
- Adjust the page title of the (partial) node edit form in the modal frame to reflect we're just editing a field or field group.
