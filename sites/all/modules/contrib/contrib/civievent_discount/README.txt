This module allows you to create discount codes tied to CiviCRM Events and
membership. It requires 'edit all events' permissions and can be accessed via
the CiviEvent Discount Management menu item in Site configuration.

Features include:
- Price sets
- Ability to add discount codes to events
- Set % discount and number of uses
- Monetary or percentage based discount
- Apply discounts to membership
- Ubercart integration
- Views integration
- and more...

To create a discount code:

1. Create an event in CiviCRM with a start date in the future.
2. Visit admin/settings/civievent_discount/add
3. Enter the code, discount, number of uses and select the events.

Now when you access the event, a 'Discount code' field should appear.
