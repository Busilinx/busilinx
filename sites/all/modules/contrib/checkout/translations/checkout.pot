msgid "Drupal's default locking strategy is optimistic, that is, whenever two users try to edit the same piece of content, the one hitting the save button first wins the race, while the other is displayed a message stating <em>this content has been modified by another user, changes cannot be saved</em>. Depending on the number of editors in your organization this might not be an acceptable solution."
