- #281584: Fixed editing locks not being released when navigating to a non-node
  url.

  installed in a subdirectory).

Check-out 6.x-2.0 2008-07-10
----------------------------
New features:

- Refactored large parts of the code.

  its own locked node.

Bugs fixed:
- Fixed node (un)locking, especially when using url aliases.

  the option to immediately check-in a locked document through a link in the
  error message.
- Added support for PostgreSQL.
- Added PHPDoc code documentation.
- Added German translation.

Bugs fixed:
