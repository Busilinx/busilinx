=========
- add depth for display terms
- nodes without category?

- count synonyms for count term?
- if show empty terms is FALSE then the vocabularies count of terms is bad

- use a table instead of variables for our data (terms/nodes selection)

- add support to display terms from several taxonomies with multiple IDs
  in the URL as in /1+2+3/ to display vocabularies 1, 2 and 3.
