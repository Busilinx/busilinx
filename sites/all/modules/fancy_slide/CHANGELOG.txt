6.x-2.5
-------
* Last release was pretty cocked up. Version number did not get updated.

6.x-2.4
-------
* Documentation change only. Made it clearer that nodequeue needs to be
  installed for multiple nodes on the same slideshow.

6.x-2.3
-------
* Set the thumbnails to a fixed height of 40px.

6.x-2.2
-------
* Completed the admin section allowing control over the slideshow options.
* Added transition_speed, continuous, show_controls and slide_controls fields to
  {fancy_slide} db table.
* Added animation field to {fancy_slide} db table.
* Moved the jQuery that fires each fancy slideshow into the slideshow template
  itself. This introduces inline jQuery, but this appears to be the best way of
  allowing each slideshow to have its own options.

6.x-2.1
-------
* Cleaned up jQuery code. Added different animations transitions (fade and slide
  for now).

6.x-2.0
-------
* Major redesign. Now possible to create slideshows via a nice interface.
* Images can now link to their nodes.

6.x-1.1
-------
* It is now possible to add alt text through the imagefield module and this will
  be used as the caption for the image on the slideshow.
  
6.x-1.0
-------
* Initial build.
