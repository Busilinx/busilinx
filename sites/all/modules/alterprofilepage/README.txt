About this module ("Alter profile page")
----------------------------------------
It's really quite simple.  When enabled, this module will change the appearance of user profile page (at http://www.example.com/user/user_name_goes_here).

Instead of saying "Member for 49 weeks 3 days" this module would change the wording to instead say "Member since June 2008" -- it will also add another field to the profile page just before the "Member since" field. This one is labeled "Last login" and it displays (you guessed it!) the user's last login date.
